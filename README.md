<h5>About Python</h5>
python is a dynamically-typed garbage-collected programming language developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 80s to replace ABC. Much like the programming language Ruby, Python was designed to be easily read by programmers. Because of its large following and many libraries, Python can be implemented and used to do anything from webpages to scientific research.
